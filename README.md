README

To compile and run:
 - Create a build folder.
 - cd into the build folder.
 - run "cmake .."
 - run "make"
 - run the program with "./final ../resources"

To play:
The cat can run forward and backwards using W and S, and turn left and right using A and D.  Use the mouse to change the user's perspective.  Press space bar when close enough to the mouse to attack.  The cat will bite and paw at the mouse and turn it to bone.
